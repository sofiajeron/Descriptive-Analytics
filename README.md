# Descriptive-Analytics

This folder includes the R Markdown file and poster that my group members did for the project of Descriptive Analytics from my Master's degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics in Nova Information Management School, Lisboa, Portugal.

The data used for this project, 'Absenteeism at work' was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work)
RMarkdown file includes the entire process of data preprocessing (cleaning the data, checking inconsistency, outliers) and analysis (PCA, MCA and clustering) including comments and R code.
Me and my group members present our work in a poster 'Poster_Descriptive.pdf', which was done in Adobe Illustrator, the plots from R were extracted as an vector image (.svg) and therefore, that allowed more detailed manipulation of the plots in Illustrator (I highly recommend it).
